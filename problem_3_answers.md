1) The ideal GitHub Network Graph shows the number of contributors, addresses number of commits based on time, branches, and forks, and shows the relationship between users related to the repository. 

2) The D3 network visualization show that mbostock makes most of the contributions to the repository and most other users are just one-time contributors, indicated by the single node that merges back to the master branch. 

The Bootstrap network visualization shows that cvrebert, ZDroid, mdo, and XhmikosR have made pretty significant contributions and the others have made one-off contributions. 

The jQuery network visualization shows that many users committed to work within a short period of time and one user made a contribution very early on.

3) Using a larger repository compared to the minimal one adds complexity in terms of number of users and branches. It shows the relationships but also forces to work with more data and scale our data accordingly. 

4) To deal with larger and more complex data, I would expand the x axis and make it interactive so that different parts of the data can be read. We could also have the graph be zoomable so a user could look more closely at a specific time interval.
