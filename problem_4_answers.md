I decided to focus on the amount of activity per user and the most recent time stamp of the user's contribution. My desired audience is project managers or even human resources that can reward users based on amount of contribution to a repository. I chose to alter the colors of the bar charts to emphasize contrast. I think a bar chart accurately depicts who stands out in terms of most activity, and the hover tooltip function allowed the user to see time stamps. I also implemented a button such that you could see the top contributors with the click of a button.

I chose not to implement the pie chart because I thought the bar chart was an adequate of example of achieving my goal of seeing which users contribute the most.
