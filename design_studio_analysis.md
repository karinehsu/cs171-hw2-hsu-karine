Part 1: Analysis

1. The networks differ in terms of users, branches, number of commits, and commit size. 

The caleydo network shows two master versions, several contributors to the Caleydo network and some forks from the sgratzl network. The mbostock network has the most users, the biggest commit size and the most number of branches. The CS171 network shows one main master version, one fork/branch by David Chouinard called gh-pages and then several merges back into the master CS171 network. 

Other attributes relevant in this graph are the relative timeline, the number of users and commits, when and what each contributor contributes, and when the network graph was last updated. 

2. The different user roles are contributors, project users that want to fork code and create their own branches and develop on their own, as well as visitors and project managers that want to manage a project or just see the development timeline of a project. 


3. Some tasks that my visualization might want to achieve are to view commit history with descriptions and github usernames, seeing who contributes what and where, and having the ability to click on a node and link to the contributor/user's github profile instead of the actual commit file. I would also make the network graph have constant time intervals.

4. I want to design my visualization for a project manager.
This means that my visualization would emphasize timeline of commits as well as the activity of users. Instead of showing lick on github profile -> social community -> see who's most active -> karma points
